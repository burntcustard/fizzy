## Fizzy Theme

Fizzy is a light syntax theme inspired by Macrabbit Espresso's default syntax highlighting color scheme, and by the [Soda Theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme) for Sublime. It features bright, primary colors on a white background. It is a syntax theme only, and will not affect the Atom UI (it works with both the Light UI scheme, and Dark UI scheme).

### Installation

Clone the git repo into your Atom packages directory: `$ cd ~/.atom/packages/ && git clone https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme.git`

Then go to `Atom > Preferences > Themes` and in the `Syntax Themes` dropdown, select `Fizzy` from the list.
